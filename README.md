# Sample Hardhat Project

# I created a factory staking contract. Then I deployed the factory through scripts. Interacted with the deployed factory contract through scripts by deploying a token. Then I used the token I deployed(via scripts) to deploy a new staking contract instance(from my factory) and then I staked 100 of the deployed token on the new staking contract instance that I deployed through my factory contract.

All interactions were done via scripts.

All code are in the scripts/ folder (With polygon scan links included as comments)

All Screenshots are in screenshot folder.
